# Convert resources to tools

Motivation: All resources must be converted to tools because not all MCP clients use tools consistently.

## Requirements
* IF YOU NEED TO VIEW DOCUMENTAITON, FIRST TRY WITH CONTEXT7.
* View the https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk API.
* Resouces MUST be replaced by tools that serve the same functionality.
* The tools must use mcp annotations.
* Do not care about backwards compatibility.
* Do NOT care about performance when calling the CyberArk Privilege Cloud API at this point.
* Before committing any code, run appropriate test cases and use `act` to execute the workflow to observe the status.
