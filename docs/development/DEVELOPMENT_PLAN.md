# MCP Server Development Plan for CyberArk Privilege Cloud

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with CyberArk Privilege Cloud as part of the Shared Services platform.

## Development Approach
- **Language**: Python
- **Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Architecture**: Follow MCP Protocol standards
- **Authentication**: API token authentication for CyberArk Identity Shared Services

## Phase 1: Research & Design

### 1. Research CyberArk Privilege Cloud APIs
- Ask me to provide the information for all CyberArk Privilege Cloud API endpoints as the documentation is not accessible.

### 2. Study MCP Protocol
- Review MCP Protocol documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io
- Study Python SDK: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
- Understand server implementation patterns

### 3. Define Server Capabilities
- Determine which CyberArk operations to expose as MCP tools
- Focus on core account management for MVP
- Plan future features (safes, passwords, sessions)

## Phase 2: Foundation (TDD Approach)

### 4. Project Setup
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install MCP Python SDK and dependencies
- Set up test framework (pytest)
- Establish project structure

### 5. Authentication Implementation
- **Write Tests First**: Create tests for API token authentication
- **Implement**: Build authentication code to pass tests
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

### 6. Core MCP Server
- **Write Tests First**: Create tests for basic MCP server structure
- **Implement**: Build server framework to pass tests
- Ensure proper MCP protocol handling

## Phase 3: Minimal Viable Product

### 7. Account Management (MVP Feature)
- **Write Tests First**: Create tests for account operations (list, get, create)
- **Implement**: Build account management functionality
- Focus on essential operations only

### 8. Integration Testing
- Write end-to-end tests for complete MCP server functionality
- Ensure all components work together
- Validate with real CyberArk environment

## Phase 4: Documentation & Validation

### 9. Documentation
- Create README with setup instructions
- Document configuration requirements
- Provide MCP Inspector testing guide

### 10. Testing with MCP Inspector
- Test complete server using MCP Inspector
- Validate all implemented tools work correctly
- Document any issues and resolutions

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### ðŸ”¥ **Immediate Priority (Next Sprint)**
- Password retrieval and management operations
- Advanced account operations (update, delete)

### ðŸš€ **Medium Priority (Future Sprints)**  
- Enhanced safe management operations
- Advanced error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimizations

### ðŸ“Š **Lower Priority (Long-term)**
- Session monitoring capabilities
- Reporting and analytics features

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Server authenticates successfully with CyberArk Privilege Cloud
- [ ] Basic account management operations work via MCP tools
- [ ] Server can be tested and validated using MCP Inspector
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] Documentation enables easy setup and configuration
